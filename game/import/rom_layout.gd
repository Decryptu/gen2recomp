extends RefCounted

## Where the data lives inside each supported cartridge.
##
## Offsets are absolute positions in the 2 MiB dump, not bank:address pairs, so
## a decoder never has to think about banking. Gold and Silver share a layout;
## Crystal moved almost everything and is its own table.
##
## Every offset here was located in the cartridges themselves, by searching for
## content whose bytes are known independently (the encoded string "BULBASAUR",
## Bulbasaur's published base stats), and then cross-checked against the pret
## disassemblies for structure. That is why there is no entry for a ROM that is
## not in [RomRegistry]: an offset table is a claim about a specific dump, and
## the honest answer for an uncharacterised one is a refusal, not a guess.
##
## An offset is only trustworthy alongside the check that proves it: see
## [method RomImporter.verify_layout], which the importer runs before it decodes
## anything.
