## Where the data lives inside each supported cartridge.
##
## Offsets are absolute positions in the 2 MiB dump, not bank:address pairs, so
## a decoder never has to think about banking. Gold and Silver share a layout;
## Crystal moved almost everything and is its own table.
##
## Every offset here was located in the cartridges themselves, by searching for
## content whose bytes are known independently (the encoded string "BULBASAUR",
## Bulbasaur's published base stats), and then cross-checked against the pret
## disassemblies for structure. That is why there is no entry for a ROM that is
## not in [RomRegistry]: an offset table is a claim about a specific dump, and
## the honest answer for an uncharacterised one is a refusal, not a guess.
##
## An offset is only trustworthy alongside the check that proves it: see
## [method RomImporter.verify_layout], which the importer runs before it decodes
## anything.

##
## Multipliers are in tenths, as the cartridge stores them, so a matchup is

## Evolutions and level-up moves are one table, not two. A species' entry lists

## Muk, whose level-up moves are not in ascending order. The cartridges ship it
## that way in all three games, and it is not a decoding artefact: pret's own
## listing carries a comment saying so.
##
## It is worth naming rather than working around, because the order is load
## bearing. Filling a fresh Pokémon's moves stops at the first entry above the
## level being filled for, so a Muk below 45 never reaches the three moves listed

## The font is indexed by character code, not by position in a sheet: its first
## tile is code $80 ("A") and its last is $FF ("9"). That is not a coincidence of
